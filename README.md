A home for the code that accompanies our final project from the Spring 2021 section of MA 575, a course offered by the College of Arts and Sciences at Boston University and taught by Ting Zhang, Julio Enrique Castrillon, and Weiliang Wang.


Please find the source code, including data preprocessing, plotting, and diagnostics in the code directory. The Rmd notebook HTML output with our results is available in the parent directory and can be opened in a browser.

To run these experiments yourself, find the data [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset). After cloning this repository on your local machine (instructions [here](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone)), run preprocessing.R and use install.packages() to install the project requirements.
